# Frontend UI Handoff (2026-02-20)

## Context

- Previous issue: app looked "unstyled" in production.
- Technical deploy issue was fixed earlier (Cloudflare Pages must serve `frontend/dist`).
- After deploy fix, core issue became visual mismatch with design spec, not missing CSS delivery.

## Source of truth

- UX spec: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/ux-design-specification.md`
- Key visual direction: "Bold Purple", mobile-first student flow, admin desktop sidebar.

## What was changed

### `frontend/src/App.css`

- Reworked layout and visual system to align with UX spec:
  - Student view: purple hero header, card-like topic list, stronger action hierarchy.
  - Mobile-first width behavior for student screens (`max-width` pattern).
  - Admin view: darker sidebar + card/surface system for dashboard/tables.
  - Improved button states, error blocks, modals, and skeleton loading visuals.
  - Responsive desktop rules for admin split layout (`sidebar + content`).

### `frontend/src/App.tsx`

- Updated user-facing copy to Ukrainian in key interaction points (labels, errors, actions).
- Added view-specific shell classes:
  - `shell--login`
  - `shell--student`
  - `shell--admin`
- Enhanced topic item structure:
  - active/open state class (`topic-accordion-item--open`)
  - availability badge (`вільна`)

### `frontend/src/index.css`

- Added Inter font import and base typography/background setup per spec direction.

### `frontend/src/apiBase.ts`

- Added production-safe API base handling for Cloudflare Pages hosts.
- New behavior:
  - uses `VITE_API_BASE_URL` when present
  - if missing and host is `*.pages.dev`, falls back to:
    - `https://58r8t1adkk.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com`
- Reason: prevent `POST /auth/login` from hitting `lit-bvd.pages.dev/auth/login` (`405`).

## Validation performed

- Build passes:
  - `npm run build` (frontend)
- Generated production assets include CSS and JS bundles.

## Notes for next agents

- Do not revert to plain utility/minimal visual style; keep alignment with UX spec.
- If design refinements continue, preserve:
  - Ukrainian UI copy consistency
  - student mobile-first flow
  - admin sidebar/card visual hierarchy
- If Cloudflare rendering looks stale, verify deployment alias and cache before changing code.
- If auth returns `405` on Pages domain, check `docs/cloudflare-pages-deploy.md` before touching UI code.

## Follow-up UI alignment (admin + login title)

The admin area was further aligned to `ux-design-directions` examples (Admin D1/D2):

- Sidebar navigation implemented as in direction examples:
  - `📊 Статус`
  - `👥 Студенти`
  - `📋 Теми`
  - `📝 Журнал дій`
- Admin UI switched to tabbed sections (single active panel) instead of rendering all sections in one long page.
- Dashboard visuals updated to match reference composition:
  - 2 status cards with left accent borders
  - progress block with `X / Y`
  - primary CSV action button
- Topics screen updated to example-like table presentation:
  - compact header actions
  - status badges (`зайнята` / `вільна`)
  - tighter table typography
- Login screen now includes project title:
  - `Вибір тем курсових робіт`
